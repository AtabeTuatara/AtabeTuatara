**Me**
- @AtabeTuatara: Physics/Math focused; dislikes "politician," "preacher," or "prosecutor" modes.
- Concerned about oligarchical resource hoarding as well as material-based incentives in crypto
- Individual growth needs self-limitation incentives to prevent resource subversion
- I can NOT contribute to the **crypto casino**. I do NOT HODL (another form of speculation).
- I avoid those who want to "live forever" & "dream of an eternal personal legacy"

**Focus Areas**
- Work on decentralization & knowledge/resource commoditization systems
- Building near-zero-cost non-proit based utility infrastructure (e.g., marketplaces, water, energy, food, communication)
