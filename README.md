- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtabeTuatara
- And 👀 I want to stay in "Scientist" mode all the time
- 👎🏼 & minimize my time in "politician", "preacher" or "prosecutor" mode.
- The current state of human tech means we can absorb and consume 4E19 erg/sec.
- We can increase that by 10 fold in less than 5 years. But we're not trying!
- Because we do not decentralize & commoditize control of our knowledge & resources.
- I want to contribute to decentralizing and commoditizing knowedge (and energy) ASAP.
- With few exceptions, I want to help humans move away from for-profit "Anytihng aaS (xaaS)" 

- I am here to help build Anything as a Utility (xaaU).
- Water is almost a utility. Food is still not a utility!
- Neither are all the things needed to set a human free of basic survival.
- Neither in the "Mmodernized" West nor in any other country! 
- Marketplaces, communication and construction are still not a utility!
- And it's getting worse. I want to move it in the other direction!

- I believe in unlimited societal & knowledge growth, not in unlimited individual growth!
- Individual growth needs to be capped; otherwise, the few dreaming to live forever will try!
- And those in who want to and have 1000x more power and money than most of us, will subvert our resources
- And keep us busy in politiciak, preacher and prosecutor modes!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Reinforcement, GraphNN and other NN related topics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine vision & intelligence
